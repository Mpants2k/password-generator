# password-generator
a simple password generator
So the way this works is basically there's a list of characters that will show up in the password and there are 16 blank variables and I had random characters from that list
be input into those blank varibles then printed it.
The basic generator is just that, very basic, nothing fancy about it.
The GUI generator is also just that, very basic but with a GUI.
